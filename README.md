# 👋 Meet Dennis Kilonzo

### Fullstack and Smart Contract Engineer | Rust & Solidity Specialist


## 🚀 About Me
I architect high-assurance decentralized systems. I am currently building hybrid Web2/Web3 infrastructure that solves real-world fragmentation in Healthcare and DeFi, utilizing Rust for performance and Solidity for trustless execution.

* **Zero-to-One Builder:** As a Founder, I'm not just a coding enthusiast meaning I design product architectures that balance technical decentralization with user experience.
* **System  Thinker:** Passion for solving complex problems with elegant architecture i.e systems engineering (Rust) with smart contract logic (Solidity)
* **Simplicity:** Believer in clean code, clear thinking, and fast iteration

## 🏗️ What I Build
1. High-performance backend systems

2. Blockchain/DeFi infrastructure

3. Scalable APIs & microservices

4. Smart contract systems (audited + production-ready)

5. Systems-level tooling and CLI utilities

## 📈 My Engineering Philosophy

1. Security and correctness first

2. Design for observability and maintainability

3. Prefer clarity over cleverness

4. Ship fast, learn faster, refactor with intention

## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [WeCare dApp](https://github.com/Kilonzo88/Health_Project_Remastered)
*A hybrid Web2/Web3 healthcare records management system.*

* **The Problem:** Medical records are currently siloed, prone to data breaches, and lack patient ownership.
* **The Technical Challenge:** Integrating decentralized identity and storage without sacrificing the user experience of traditional social logins.
* **The Solution:** Engineered a Flutter-based mobile interface backed by Rust and Solidity smart contracts. Implemented a robust data lifecycle that ensures clinical privacy while granting patients sovereign ownership of their history.
* **Stack:** `Rust` `Solidity` `Flutter` `Decentralized Identity`

### 🔹 [Decentralised Stable Coin](https://github.com/Talent-Index/StableCoin-Project)
*An algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar.*

* **The Problem:** Traditional stablecoins rely on centralized custodians, introducing counterparty risk.
* **The Technical Challenge:** Maintaining a strict 1:1 peg entirely on-chain without fiat reserves.
* **The Solution:** Developed an algorithmic minting engine that uses Bitcoin and Ethereum as over-collateralized assets to ensure solvency.
* **The Impact:** Provides a transparent, censorship-resistant medium of exchange compatible with the wider DeFi ecosystem.
* **Stack:** `Solidity` `Foundry` `Chainlink PriceFeed Oracles`

### 🔹 [LendingAPYAggregator](https://github.com/Kilonzo88/Lending_APY_Aggregator)
*The project aggregates borrowing and lending rates from multiple DeFi protocols and recommends the best one.*

* **The Problem:** DeFi participants and crypto-savvy investors seeking optimal lending/borrow yields across multiple protocols and chains face significant challenges.
* **The Technical Challenge:** Blockchain interoperability of the different protocols is gas fee intensive.
* **The Solution:** Ensure the frontend calls the fluctuating APY rates while the gas fee optimized smart contracts handle the core logic of lending and borrowing
* **The Impact:** Empowers users and automated agents to effortlessly find the most efficient lending opportunities across DeFi, driving safer participation and smarter capital flow across the entire ecosystem.
.
* **Stack:** `Solidity` `Foundry` `Chainlink CCIP`
