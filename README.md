# 👋 Meet Dennis Kilonzo

### Fullstack and Smart Contract Engineer | Rust & Solidity Specialist


## 🚀 About Me
I build high-assurance decentralized systems. I am currently building hybrid Web2/Web3 infrastructure that solves real-world fragmentation in Healthcare and DeFi, utilizing Rust for performance and Solidity for trustless execution.

* **Zero-to-One Builder:** As an aspiring Founder, I don't  just code for the sake of it. I understand the importance of shipping value and therefore I design product architectures that balance technical decentralization, scalability and user experience.
* **System  Thinker:** Passion for solving complex problems with elegant architecture i.e systems engineering (Rust) with smart contract logic (Solidity)
* **Simplicity:** No spaghetti code. I believe in clean code, and clear thinking.

## 🏗️ What I Build
1. High-performance backend systems

2. Blockchain/DeFi infrastructure

3. Scalable APIs & microservices

4. Smart contract systems (audited + production-ready)

## 📈 My Engineering Philosophy

1. Security and correctness first

2. Design for observability and maintainability

3. Prefer clarity over cleverness

4. Ship fast, learn faster, refactor with intention

## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [WeCare dApp](https://github.com/Kilonzo88/Health_Project_Remastered)
*A hybrid Web2/Web3 healthcare records management system.*

* **The Problem:** Medical records are currently siloed, prone to data breaches, and lack patient ownership.
* **The Technical Challenge:** Integrating decentralized identity and storage without sacrificing the user experience of traditional social logins.
* **The Solution:** Engineered a Flutter-based mobile interface backed by Rust and Solidity smart contracts. Implemented a robust data lifecycle that ensures clinical privacy while granting patients sovereign ownership of their history.
* **Stack:** `Rust` `Solidity` `Openzeppelin` `Flutter` `Decentralized Identity` `Hedera Concencus Service`

### 🔹 [Decentralised Stable Coin](https://github.com/Talent-Index/StableCoin-Project)
*An algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar.*

* **The Problem:** Traditional stablecoins rely on centralized custodians, introducing counterparty risk.
* **The Technical Challenge:** Maintaining a strict 1:1 peg entirely on-chain without fiat reserves.
* **The Solution:** Developed an algorithmic minting engine that uses Bitcoin and Ethereum as over-collateralized assets to ensure solvency.
* **The Impact:** Provides a transparent, censorship-resistant medium of exchange compatible with the wider DeFi ecosystem.
* **Stack:** `Avalanche's C-Chain` `Ethereum L1` `Solidity`  `Chainlink PriceFeed Oracles` `Openzeppelin`

### 🔹 [LendingAPYAggregator](https://github.com/Kilonzo88/Lending_APY_Aggregator)
*The project aggregates borrowing and lending rates from multiple DeFi protocols and recommends the best one.*

* **The Problem:** DeFi participants and crypto-savvy investors seeking optimal lending/borrow yields across multiple protocols and chains face significant challenges.
* **The Technical Challenge:** Blockchain interoperability of the different protocols is gas fee intensive.
* **The Solution:** Ensure the frontend calls the fluctuating APY rates while the gas fee optimized smart contracts handle the core logic of lending and borrowing. The MVP aggregates Morpho on base and Aave on Avalanche C-Chain
* **The Impact:** Empowers users and automated agents to effortlessly find the most efficient lending opportunities across DeFi, driving safer participation and smarter capital flow across the entire ecosystem.
.
* **Stack:** `Avalanche's C-Chain` `Base` `Aave` `Solidity` `Chainlink CCIP` `Openzeppelin`

## ✍️ Latest Writing
*Technical deep dives and architectural thinking published on Substack and Medium.*
* **[How Blockchain Could Fix What’s Broken in Elections](https://medium.com/@dennis.m.kilonzo3/how-blockchain-could-fix-whats-broken-in-elections-f420ae12ccce):** From disputed results to sky-high costs, democracies worldwide are struggling with electoral integrity. The technology behind cryptocurrency might offer a way forward.

* **[Beyond the Web3 Hype](https://kilonzo.substack.com/p/beyond-the-web-3-hype-why-smart-money):** The volatility of the past was the price of discovery. The stability of the future will be the prize of utility.
