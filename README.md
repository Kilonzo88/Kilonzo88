# 👋 Meet Dennis Kilonzo

### Smart Contract Engineer & Founder | Rust & Solidity Specialist

> 🚀 **The Hook:** I architect high-assurance decentralized systems. I am currently building hybrid Web2/Web3 infrastructure that solves real-world fragmentation in Healthcare and DeFi, utilizing Rust for performance and Solidity for trustless execution.

## 🚀 About Me
* **Zero-to-One Builder:** As a Founder, I don't just write code; I design product architectures that balance technical decentralization with user experience.
* **Polymath Approach:** I combine systems engineering (Rust) with smart contract logic (Solidity) to build full-stack decentralized applications.
* **Current Focus:** Creating a "Hybrid Decentralized Identity System" to revolutionize how patient data is secured and shared.

---

## 🏗️ What I Build
* **DeFi Primitives:** Algorithmic stablecoins and collateralized lending protocols.
* **Decentralized Identity (DID):** Privacy-preserving identity solutions for sensitive sectors like Healthcare.
* **Hybrid Architectures:** Systems that bridge the gap between traditional Web2 auth (Social Logins) and Web3 custody.

## 🏆 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [WeCare dApp](https://github.com/Kilonzo88/Health_Project_Remastered)
*A hybrid Web2/Web3 healthcare records management system.*

* **The Problem:** Medical records are currently siloed, prone to data breaches, and lack patient ownership.
* **The Technical Challenge:** Integrating decentralized identity and storage without sacrificing the user experience of traditional social logins.
* **The Solution:** Engineered a Flutter-based mobile interface backed by Rust and Solidity smart contracts. Implemented a robust data lifecycle that ensures clinical privacy while granting patients sovereign ownership of their history.
* **Stack:** `Rust` `Solidity` `Flutter` `Decentralized Identity`

### 🔹 [Decentralised Stable Coin](https://github.com/Talent-Index/StableCoin-Project)
*An algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar.*

* **The Problem:** Traditional stablecoins rely on centralized custodians, introducing counterparty risk.
* **The Technical Challenge:** Maintaining a strict 1:1 peg entirely on-chain without fiat reserves.
* **The Solution:** Developed an algorithmic minting engine that uses Bitcoin and Ethereum as over-collateralized assets to ensure solvency.
* **The Impact:** Provides a transparent, censorship-resistant medium of exchange compatible with the wider DeFi ecosystem.
* **Stack:** `Solidity` `Foundry` `Chainlink Oracles`

## 📈 Engineering Philosophy
* **Security is Non-Negotiable:** In Web3, a bug isn't just an error; it's a financial loss. I prioritize rigorous testing and formal verification concepts.
* **User Experience First:** Decentralization shouldn't hurt. I build systems where the "crypto" is invisible to the end-user.
* **Ship to Learn:** I believe in rapid prototyping to validate assumptions, followed by rigorous refactoring for production.
